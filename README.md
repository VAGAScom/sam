Sam, the shepphered, will look after your unicorns so that they play nice with `upstarts` and even `systemds`. 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'sam'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sam

## Usage

**Sam** comes with the following commands:

1. `unicorn start`: starts an  `unicorn` instance
2. `unicorn stop`: stops an `unicorn` instance
3. `unicorn monitor`: start a monitoring loop over the running `unicorn` instance. It will forward the signals `HUP, USR2, TERM, QUIT, TTIN, TTOU` to the `unicorn` instance. `HUP` will do an graceful reload of the application
4. `unicorn reload`: reloads the `unicorn` instance by issuing a `USR2` followed by a `QUIT` signal a few seconds later
5. `unicorn run`: starts and monitors an `unicorn` instance

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
