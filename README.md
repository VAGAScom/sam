Sam, the shepphered, will look after your unicorns so that they play nice with `upstarts` and even `systemds`. 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'sam-shepherd'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sam

## Usage

**Sam** is pretty straightforward and you can rely on its internal documentation. By invoking `sam` you can see the list of available commands. For a more in-depth help for each command, you can pass a `-h` flag to it, like this: `sam run -h`


## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
